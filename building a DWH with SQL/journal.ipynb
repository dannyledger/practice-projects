    "- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.\n",
    "- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.\n",
    "- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams."

So for a data warehouse, SoC means breaking the architecture into independent layers—such as ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption—so each layer handles its own responsibility without interfering with the others...\n",
