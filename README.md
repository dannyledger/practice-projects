## Welcome to my technical skill portfolio 🛠️💡😊

This is where I house all my _(audience-friendly)_ practice projects and case studies. 
The majority of my work in SQL and Python is produced with an aim of demonstrating _developing_-skills in various aspects of data, particulary data engineering.

The various tasks and datasets likely originate either from DataCamp’s various courses, Udemy bootcamps, or various code-alongs available online from tech companies and YouTube.

Below is an overview of the very projects that can be found, and the skills they look to demonstrate.
